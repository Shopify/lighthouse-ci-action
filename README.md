## About this repo

[Lighthouse CI](https://github.com/googleChrome/lighthouse-ci) on Shopify Theme Pull Requests using GitHub Actions.

## Usage

Add `shopify/lighthouse-ci-action` to the workflow of your Shopify theme.

```yml
# .github/workflows/lighthouse-ci.yml
name: Shopify Lighthouse CI
on: [push]
jobs:
  lhci:
    name: Lighthouse
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Lighthouse
        uses: shopify/lighthouse-ci-action@1.0
        with:
          app_id: ${{ secrets.SHOP_APP_ID }}
          app_password: ${{ secrets.SHOP_APP_PASSWORD }}
          store: ${{ secrets.SHOP_STORE }}
          lhci_github_app_token: ${{ secrets.LHCI_GITHUB_APP_TOKEN }}
          lhci_min_score_performance: 0.9
          lhci_min_score_accessibility: 0.9
```

## Authentication

Authentication is done with private app credentials. The same ones you'd use with [Theme Kit](https://shopify.dev/tools/theme-kit/getting-started#step-2-generate-api-credentials).

You will need to provide the `app_id`, `app_password` and `store` as parameters to the GitHub action. It is recommended to set these as [GitHub secrets](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/encrypted-secrets#creating-encrypted-secrets-for-an-environment) on your repo.

```yml
jobs:
  lhci:
    name: Lighthouse
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Lighthouse
        uses: shopify/lighthouse-ci-action@1.0
        with:
          app_id: ${{ secrets.SHOP_APP_ID }}
          app_password: ${{ secrets.SHOP_APP_PASSWORD }}
          store: ${{ secrets.SHOP_STORE }}
```
